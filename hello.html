<p> [MUSIC] Hi and welcome back to our week <strong> two </strong> <br>
lessons. You may remember from earlier that we <br>
<em>created a template like the one we're looking <br>
at here to use as a basis for</em> our future HTML <br>
files. So I've taken this template, and I've <br>
saved it as html2.html and made a edited few changes,<br>
 calling it My Second Page and experimenting with Links and Text.</p>
